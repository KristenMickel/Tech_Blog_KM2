## Description
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a blog site that would allow developers to post comments, thoughts, and ideas regarding their work. The site was intended to use the Model-View-Controller framework, which is an architectural pattern that adheres to the separation of concerns principle. Separation of Concerns focuses on creating a program with distinct sections that only address one specific concern. In my assignment, Sequelize was used for the ORM, SQL was used for the relational database, node.js and express.js were used for the server, and Handlebars.js was used for the template engine, or the rendering of the views. While my site successfully implemented the login/logout and user sign-up, I was not able to successfully implement posting blog comments to the site. For the sake of time, I also did not apply the specific structure and styling shown in the example.

## Installation
You need to have node.js, express.js, Sequelize, and SQL installed on your local computer before running my program.
